Some projects:
- [Vampire Guide](https://github.com/MikPisula/vampire-guide/) - 2x 1st Place @ Hack4change 2024. Aggregate shadow data from anywhere, anytime. Find the shadiest and shortest path
- [Orthogonal skip connections](https://github.com/gournge/orthogonal-skip-connections) - I improved a mathematical construction of the ResNet architecture and challenged the claims of another paper 
- [SIGG Pairs-Trading](https://gournge.github.io/posts/High-school-competition-and-pairs-trading/) - Implemented a Pairs-Trading strategy, approximating a short position with an ETF inverse to WIG20 (isin: ETFBW20ST.PL)
- [Cleaning optimization](https://github.com/gournge/cleaning-optimization) - Supervised project in which an RL agent learns to use a 2D broom
- [Copernicus transactions](https://github.com/gournge/copernicus-transactions) - Part of an Economics essay contest submission. Agents make multi-currency transactions and then the Copernicus-Gresham law emerges
